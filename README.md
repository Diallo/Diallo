### Hello ðŸ‘‹


I'm currently a MSc Software Systems Engineering student @ UCL. In 2020 I graduated from the University of Amsterdam with a bachelors in Computer Science. I am originally from Amsterdam ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, but I have spent some time in ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Singapore (NTU) and currently located in London. 

I have a passion for financial markets, distributed systems, and the technology and challenges involved with peer-to-peer exchanges.
